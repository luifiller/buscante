# Buscante

This project was developed during [Alura's course](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/rxjs-angular-programando-forma-reativa) and was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.3.

## API used
The [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) was used to facilitate the handling of HTTP responses, and also helped with the learning about `Observable`, `Observer` and `subscribe` concepts, including `pipe`, `tap` and `map` RxJS operators.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
